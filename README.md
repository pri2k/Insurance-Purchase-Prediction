# Insurance Purchase Prediction

This project uses a neural network with gradient descent to predict insurance purchases based on age and affordability.

## Description

The project involves building a neural network model to predict whether a customer will buy insurance based on their age and affordability. The model is trained using a dataset of customer information and employs binary cross-entropy loss with the Adam optimizer. The project also includes custom implementations of sigmoid activation, log loss function, and gradient descent.
